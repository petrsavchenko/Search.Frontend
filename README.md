# Search.Frontend

Forked [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with TS.

It is client side of [Search.API](https://github.com/petrsavchenko/Search.API).

There is a brief description:
  * React Hooks
  * Standard html inputs (so no fancy design)
  * Error handling
  * Async load of multiple requests
